Welcome dear visitor,
The next project is a shopping basket project which was created using Html, Javascript, Css.
This is one of the most complex Javascript projects I have done so far.
The project contains complex functions of adding items and selecting quantities while calculating them and providing a total price, all with the help of an accessible and intuitive design for the user.
I hope you will be impressed by my project and with any questions do not hesitate to contact me through my portfolio website.
